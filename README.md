ðŸ“š Unity XR Toolkit Demo Scenes:
* **XRDirectInteractorsWithSimple:** XR Direct interactors with XR Simple Interactables by controlling 3 flash lights and binding interactable events to LoggerUI
  
* **XRDirectInteractorsHaptics&Audio:** Same as above but with additional haptics and audio during interactions
  
* **XRAffordanceSystem:** XR Direct interactors with affordance system which applies scaling, color, and rotation changes to objects
  
* **XRInteractionLayers:** Using interaction layers to restrict which objects can be interacted with XR Direct And XR Ray interactors
  
* **XRRayInteractorsWithSimple:** This demo shows you how to can do hover and selections by using a Ray Interactor with a straight line, Ray Interactor with a bezier curve, and how to change their default line colors
  
* **XRDebuggingDemo:** This demo allows you to play a very basic game where your goal is simply to place the cone on top of the crate to win. We will be using this demo to show you how to debug
  
* **XRDirectRayPokeWithGrab:** This demo is an intro to XR Grab Interactable with physical components that allow you to throw a ball and aim at a basket
  
* **XRSnapAndContinuous:** Example uses Locomotion System: including Continuous movement, Snap Turn, and Continuous Turn providers. Enable & Disable Continuous or Snap Turn providers on XR Origin to use one over the other
  
* **XRTeleportation:** Another example of Locomotion where we use teleporting anchors and teleporting areas to quickly reach different places, move & snap rotation are also available
  
* **XRCharacterAndGrabMove:** Another example of Locomotion where we use a character controller, a character driver, and one handed / two handed grab move providers for movement
  
* **XRInputDemo:** This demo demonstrates how to use Input Action Properties to capture input and how to send haptic impulses to controllers

* **XRGrabTransformers:** This demo covers how to work with the various grab transformers for one hand or two hands. This allows you to set a priotity when trying to grab items with two hands, also add contraints when scaling objects among other grab features
